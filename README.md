# Fullstack X Squared Clone: Next.js 13, React, Typescript, Prisma, Clerk, Tailwind CSS, Cloudinary, MySQL, Shadcn UI, Zustand

This project does not implement Websockets, so it still has defects in toggle like, bookmark and follow. and it took me about 3-4 weeks to do it, and of course I learned a lot of new things.

## Demo Notice

If you can't open it or there are problems, most likely my railway hobby plan has run out :(.
So run it locally if you want to see all the features.

because I use a hobby plan from railway, the performance presented by my website will not be very good, maybe there will be a delay of 1-5 seconds, when querying.
